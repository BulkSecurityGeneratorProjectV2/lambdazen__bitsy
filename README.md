### Git branching strategy

Tags are named release-[version]. Versions start with 3.0. For e.g., release-3.0

A note on branch names:

- master: Unstable snapshot of the software on the last-released major version
- dev-[major-version]-branch: Contains newer major versions that are not ready for release. For e.g., dev-3.5-branch
- release-[major-version].x-branch: Contains older major versions which are supported. For e.g., release-3.0-branch
